# Contributing to `opensuse-spotify-installer`

Development lives at the home page:

* [https://github.com/aspiers/opensuse-spotify-installer](https://github.com/aspiers/opensuse-spotify-installer)

## Issue tracking

Any kind of feedback is very welcome, but **please first check that your bug
/ issue / enhancement request is not already listed here**:

*   https://github.com/aspiers/opensuse-spotify-installer/issues

and if not then file a new issue.

I can't guarantee that I'll be able to fix it, or even respond,
but I'll try, and even if I can't help, this is github, so anyone else
can potentially help you out too.

## Helping with development

Even better, if you know how to fix an existing issue, and you have
checked that
[there is not already a pull request addressing it](https://github.com/aspiers/opensuse-spotify-installer/pulls),
please
[fork this repository](https://github.com/aspiers/opensuse-spotify-installer/fork_select),
commit your fix, and then send me a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)!

However my spare time to work on this project is very limited, so
please follow these
[guidelines on contributing](http://blog.adamspiers.org/2012/11/10/7-principles-for-contributing-patches-to-software-projects/) so that you can help me to help you ;-)

Thanks in advance!
